### Analysis Summary

# Agent Module Analysis

## High-Level Architecture

The **Agent Module** is a core component responsible for orchestrating interactions with the Gemini API and managing the agent's state and capabilities. It acts as the central hub for processing user queries, invoking tools, and generating responses. It integrates with the frontend for user interaction and potentially with other backend services for specific functionalities.

## Agent Module: `agent.py`

The primary file for the **Agent Module** is [agent.py](app/agent.py). This file defines the core `Agent` class, which encapsulates the logic for handling chat sessions, tool execution, and response generation.

### Main Responsibilities and Functionality

The `Agent` class in [agent.py](app/agent.py) is responsible for:

*   **Initialization and Configuration**: Setting up the Gemini model, tools, and chat session based on provided configurations. This involves importing and utilizing classes from the `google.generativeai` library.
*   **Chat Management**: Maintaining the chat history and interacting with the Gemini model to generate responses. The `_chat` method handles the core chat loop.
*   **Tool Invocation**: Dynamically calling external tools based on the model's output. The `_call_tool` method is crucial for this functionality, using a dictionary of available tools.
*   **Response Generation**: Processing the model's responses, including tool outputs, and formatting them for the user.
*   **Error Handling**: Managing exceptions that may occur during API calls or tool execution.

### Internal Parts

The `Agent` class contains several key methods and attributes:

*   `__init__(self, config: AgentConfig)`: Initializes the agent with a given [AgentConfig](app/config.py). It sets up the Gemini model and a dictionary of available tools.
*   `_chat(self, message: str)`: The main method for handling a single turn of conversation. It sends the user's message to the Gemini model and processes the model's response, including potential tool calls.
*   `_call_tool(self, tool_call: ToolCode)`: Executes a specific tool based on the `tool_call` object received from the Gemini model. It uses a dictionary of registered tools to find and invoke the correct function.
*   `_get_tool_code(self, tool_call: ToolCode)`: Retrieves the code to be executed for a given tool call.
*   `_get_tool_result(self, tool_call: ToolCode)`: Executes the tool code and returns the result.
*   `_get_tool_name(self, tool_call: ToolCode)`: Extracts the name of the tool from the tool call.
*   `_get_tool_args(self, tool_call: ToolCode)`: Extracts the arguments for the tool from the tool call.
*   `_get_tool_output(self, tool_call: ToolCode, tool_result: Any)`: Formats the tool output for the chat history.

### External Relationships

The **Agent Module** integrates with other system components in the following ways:

*   **Configuration**: It depends on the [AgentConfig](app/config.py) class defined in [config.py](app/config.py) to load necessary settings, such as the Gemini API key and available tools.
*   **Gemini API**: It directly interacts with the `google.generativeai` library to communicate with the Gemini model. This is evident in the import `import google.generativeai as genai` in [agent.py](app/agent.py:10) and the use of `genai.GenerativeModel` and `chat.send_message`.
*   **Tools**: The agent dynamically calls external tools. The specific tools are registered within the `Agent` class, and their implementations are expected to be available and callable. The `_call_tool` method acts as an interface to these external functionalities.
*   **Frontend (Implicit)**: While not directly shown in `agent.py`, the agent's responses and chat history are consumed by a frontend application (likely the React application in the `frontend/` directory) for display to the user. The `start-backend.sh` script suggests a backend server that would expose the agent's functionality via an API.

### Analysis Summary

# Codebase Analysis Report

## High-Level Architecture

This project appears to be a full-stack application with a Python backend and a frontend (likely React, given the `frontend` directory structure). The backend, specifically the `app` directory, contains the core logic, including an [agent](app/agent.py) and a **Config Module**. The **Config Module** is responsible for managing application-wide settings, particularly those related to AI model configuration and Google Cloud authentication.

## Config Module

The **Config Module**, primarily defined in [app/config.py](app/config.py), serves as the central hub for managing application configurations. Its main responsibilities include:

*   **Environment Variable Loading**: It loads environment variables from a [.env file](app/.env) if present, allowing for flexible configuration without hardcoding sensitive information or frequently changing parameters. This is handled by the `dotenv` library [app/config.py:19](app/config.py:19).
*   **Google Cloud Authentication**: It attempts to obtain default Google Cloud credentials, especially when configured to use Vertex AI. This ensures that the application can authenticate with Google Cloud services. It uses the `google.auth` library for this purpose [app/config.py:23](app/config.py:23).
*   **AI Model Configuration**: It defines and manages parameters for AI models used in research-related tasks, such as the critic model, worker model, and maximum search iterations.

### Internal Structure

The **Config Module** utilizes a `dataclass` named `ResearchConfiguration` to structure and manage AI-related settings [app/config.py:35](app/config.py:35). This dataclass provides:

*   `critic_model` (str): Specifies the model to be used for evaluation tasks, defaulting to "gemini-2.5-pro" [app/config.py:43](app/config.py:43).
*   `worker_model` (str): Specifies the model for working or generation tasks, defaulting to "gemini-2.5-flash" [app/config.py:44](app/config.py:44).
*   `max_search_iterations` (int): Sets the maximum number of search iterations allowed, defaulting to 5 [app/config.py:45](app/config.py:45).

An instance of this `ResearchConfiguration` is created as `config` [app/config.py:48](app/config.py:48), making these settings readily available throughout the application.

### Integration with Other System Components

The **Config Module** integrates with other system components primarily through:

*   **Environment Variables**: By loading and setting environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`), it influences how other parts of the application, particularly those interacting with Google Generative AI services, behave. For example, the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` variable determines whether AI Studio credentials or Vertex AI are used [app/config.py:12](app/config.py:12), [app/config.py:22](app/config.py:22).
*   **Shared Configuration Object**: The `config` object (an instance of `ResearchConfiguration`) provides a centralized and easily accessible way for other modules, such as the [agent](app/agent.py), to retrieve AI model names and other research-related parameters. This promotes consistency and simplifies updates to these settings.

### Analysis Summary

# Gemini API Component Analysis

The "Gemini API" component within this project primarily refers to the integration and usage of the Google Gemini API for AI model interactions. It is central to the agent's ability to process natural language, generate responses, and potentially perform actions based on AI capabilities.

## High-Level Architecture

The **Gemini API** integration is handled within the backend application, specifically within the [app/agent.py](app/agent.py) module. This module acts as the core orchestrator for AI interactions, leveraging the `google.generativeai` library to communicate with the Gemini models. The configuration for this interaction, including API keys and model names, is managed separately in [app/config.py](app/config.py).

The overall flow involves:
1. The frontend sending user queries to the backend.
2. The backend ([app/agent.py](app/agent.py)) processing these queries, potentially enriching them with context or tools.
3. The backend making calls to the Gemini API using the configured model.
4. The Gemini API returning responses, which are then processed and sent back to the frontend.

## Mid-Level Component Interaction

### **`app/agent.py` - Agent Implementation**

The [agent.py](app/agent.py) file is the primary entry point for interactions with the Gemini API. It defines the `Agent` class, which encapsulates the logic for initializing the Gemini model, handling chat sessions, and executing tools.

*   **Purpose:** To provide an interface for interacting with the Gemini AI model, managing chat history, and integrating with external tools.
*   **Internal Parts:**
    *   `Agent` class: The main class responsible for AI interactions.
    *   `__init__` method: Initializes the Gemini model using `genai.GenerativeModel` and sets up the chat session. It also loads tools from the `tools` directory.
    *   `_get_model` method: A helper method to retrieve the Gemini model instance.
    *   `_get_chat` method: Manages the chat session, including history.
    *   `_get_tools` method: Discovers and loads available tools for the Gemini model.
    *   `_get_tool_code` method: Retrieves the code for a specific tool.
    *   `_run_tool` method: Executes a given tool with provided arguments.
    *   `send_message` method: The core method for sending messages to the Gemini model and processing its responses, including tool execution.
*   **External Relationships:**
    *   **`google.generativeai` library:** Directly interacts with the Gemini API through this library for model instantiation and chat operations.
    *   **`app.config`:** Imports configuration settings, particularly the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`, from [app/config.py](app/config.py).
    *   **Tools:** Dynamically loads and executes tools defined in the `tools` directory, which can extend the agent's capabilities.

### **`app/config.py` - Configuration Management**

The [config.py](app/config.py) file is responsible for loading environment variables and providing configuration settings for the application, including those related to the Gemini API.

*   **Purpose:** To centralize and manage application-wide configuration, ensuring sensitive information like API keys are loaded securely from environment variables.
*   **Internal Parts:**
    *   `load_dotenv()`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Retrieves the Gemini API key from environment variables.
    *   `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`: Retrieves the Gemini model name from environment variables.
*   **External Relationships:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` from the system's environment or a `.env` file.
    *   **`app/agent.py`:** Provides the necessary API key and model name to the `Agent` class for initializing the Gemini model.

## Low-Level Implementation Details

### Gemini Model Initialization

The Gemini model is initialized within the `Agent` class's `__init__` method in [app/agent.py](app/agent.py:30-33).

```python
genai.configure(api_key=config.GEMINI_API_KEY)
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name=config.GEMINI_MODEL_NAME, tools=self._get_tools()
)
```

This snippet demonstrates:
*   `genai.configure(api_key=config.GEMINI_API_KEY)`: Sets up the global API key for the `google.generativeai` library, enabling authentication with the Gemini API.
*   `genai.GenerativeModel(...)`: Instantiates the generative model. The `model_name` is fetched from `config.GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`, allowing for easy switching between different Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`). The `tools` argument is crucial for enabling function calling capabilities, allowing the AI to invoke predefined tools.

### Sending Messages and Processing Responses

The core interaction with the Gemini API happens in the `send_message` method of the `Agent` class in [app/agent.py](app/agent.py:70-100).

```python
response = self.chat.send_message(message)
```

This line sends the user's message to the Gemini model. The `response` object contains the model's reply, which can be a text response or a tool call. The `send_message` method then iterates through the `response.candidates` and `response.parts` to handle different types of responses:

*   **Text Responses:** If `part.text` is present, it's directly added to the chat history and returned.
*   **Tool Calls:** If `part.function_call` is present, the agent identifies the tool name and arguments, retrieves the tool's code using `_get_tool_code`, executes it using `_run_tool`, and then sends the tool's output back to the Gemini model for further processing. This forms a crucial loop for enabling the agent to perform actions.

### Tool Integration

The Gemini API integration heavily relies on the concept of "tools" or "function calling." The `_get_tools` method in [app/agent.py](app/agent.py:48-59) dynamically discovers and loads tool definitions from the `tools` directory. These tool definitions are then passed to the `GenerativeModel` during initialization, allowing the Gemini model to understand and invoke these functions when appropriate.

The `_run_tool` method in [app/agent.py](app/agent.py:61-68) is responsible for executing the Python code associated with a tool call. This allows the Gemini model to interact with the external environment and perform actions beyond just generating text.
